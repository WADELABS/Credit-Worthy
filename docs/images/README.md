# CredStack Screenshots & Visual Assets

This directory contains screenshots and demo assets for the CredStack project documentation.

## Current Assets

### Screenshots (SVG Placeholders)
- **dashboard-overview.svg** - Main dashboard view showing credit score, utilization, and activity

- **reports-view.svg** - Analytics and reporting dashboard with trends

### Demo Assets

## Usage

These assets are referenced in the main README.md and documentation files. They are currently SVG placeholders that demonstrate the layout and features.

## Replacing Placeholders

To replace these with actual screenshots:

1. Run the CredStack application locally
2. Navigate to each major section
3. Take screenshots (1200x800 recommended for consistency)
4. Save as PNG or keep as SVG
5. Replace the placeholder files with the same names

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: SVG (current) or PNG (recommended for actual screenshots)
- **Resolution**: 1200x800px for consistency
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB per image
- **Naming**: Use descriptive kebab-case names
- **Alt text**: Ensure all images have descriptive alt text in documentation
