## 🎯 Advanced Workflows

### Statement Date Optimization

**Goal:** Report lowest possible balances to credit bureaus

```
Before Statement Date:
1. Check current balance (5 days before)
2. Calculate target payment (to reach <10% utilization)
3. Make payment (3 days before statement)
4. Verify new balance after posting
5. Statement reports optimized balance
```

**Example:**
- Credit limit: $10,000
- Target utilization: <10% ($1,000)
- Current balance: $3,500
- Required payment: $2,500
- Pay $2,500 → New balance: $1,000 (10% utilization)

### Multi-Account Strategy

**Goal:** Optimize utilization across multiple cards

```
1. List all accounts and limits
2. Calculate aggregate utilization
3. Identify highest-utilization accounts
4. Redistribute balances or pay down strategically
5. Monitor overall utilization percentage
```

**Formula:**
```
Total Utilization = (Sum of All Balances / Sum of All Limits) × 100
```

**Target:** Keep aggregate utilization under 10%

### Credit Recovery Workflow

**Goal:** Rebuild credit from poor standing

```
Month 1-2:  Add all accounts → Set up automations → Never miss payments
Month 3-4:  Pay down high balances → Target utilization under 30%
Month 5-6:  Optimize utilization to <10% → File disputes for errors
Month 7-12: Maintain consistency → See score improvements
```

**Expected Timeline:**
- 30 days: Automation habits established
- 90 days: First score improvement visible
- 180 days: Significant progress with consistency
- 365 days: Full recovery possible with perfect execution
