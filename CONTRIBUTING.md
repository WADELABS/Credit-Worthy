# Contributing to WADELABS

We welcome contributions that move the substrate toward higher fidelity and zero-hallucination.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/high-fidelity-improvement`).
3. Implement your changes with standardized docstrings and unit tests.
4. Ensure all tests pass (`pytest tests/`).
5. Submit a pull request.

## Standards
- **Zero-Shadow-State**: No unused code or undocumented variables.
- **Forensic Tone**: Documentation must be technical, authoritative, and concise.
- **Testing**: 80%+ coverage required for all new features.
