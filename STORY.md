# The Story Behind CredStack

*A Fixer's Log*

My friend kept getting crushed by credit card interest. Not because she was irresponsible—because the payments always came due at the worst times. A big purchase here, a forgotten autopay there. The banks loved it. She hated it.

I built CredStack to run locally on her machine, watching her accounts without sending data anywhere. It learned her patterns and started flagging potential utilization spikes before they happened. Last month, she paid zero interest for the first time in three years.

The technical challenge wasn't building another cloud dashboard—it was making something that worked entirely offline, with heuristics tunable to individual behavior patterns. CredStack is what emerged.
