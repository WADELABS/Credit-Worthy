# Project Background: CredStack

I developed CredStack to address a common problem with automated financial tools: cloud dependency. Many tools that track spending require uploading sensitive account information to external servers.

CredStack runs entirely locally. It was originally built to help a friend manage credit card interest. By monitoring account patterns and flagging potential balance increases before payment dates, the tool helped her avoid interest charges for the first time in several years.

The goal was to create a functional dashboard that operates offline, using simple rules that can be adjusted to fit individual needs.
